Project 4 
--------------

		This is Final Project of CSCI E -15  (Auto  Taxi Reservation  Portal)
		=================================================
The main aim of the Project is to make auto Taxi reservation and store customer information in Database.
First customer will sign up using his or her personal information First Name , Last Name, E-mail and Password. 
After customer sign up user will login using E-mail ID and Password as his or her own credentials.
		
		Then we will make Taxi reservation providing pickup and drop off locations including the First Name and Last Name 
will be populated. We have fill all fields including pick up time. We have drop down to select vehicle type  and payment type.
You can  pay using credit card also . Once you entered pick up and drop off locations, the application will calculate 
total amount. You can use Zip codes as well (Ex : Newton MA, Cambridge MA, etc.,) . For this calculation I am using existing 
google API. All this information will be saved in Database except Credit card Numbers. I have created two tables reservations and users 
to store customer information.
